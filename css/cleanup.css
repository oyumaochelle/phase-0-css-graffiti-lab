#tag-2 { display: none; }
/* This selector simply targets the element with the ID tag-2.

/* This selector is more complex, targeting the element with the ID tag-6 that is nested three levels deep within the element with the class parent. 
It has more specificity due to the combination of class and ID selectors, as well as the descendant relationship.*/

/* This selector uses the nth-child pseudo-class to target the second div element within the element with the class parent that also has a descendant element with the ID tag-7.
